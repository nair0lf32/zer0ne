//the guy got a secret-suff dir with an echo panel

(ugh...regexes   /[#!@%^&*()$_=\[\]\';,{}:>?~\\\\]/  )


//the panel just echoes whatever goes in...it uses a search argument

//fooling around with it it doesnt echo some charachters: " (double quote)

//lmao some are sanitized : ' (single quote), # (hashtag)...and many more
You really think this is gonna be possible i fixed this @Deadalus -_- !!!? 

//actually only one special char allows us to escape that regex : ` (that..thing)

//nevermind | (pipe vertical bar works too)...

//hoho I feel like injecting a shell there

//base64 encodig the payload it is
