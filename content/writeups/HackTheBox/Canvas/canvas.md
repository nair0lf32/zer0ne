This challene is very easy! its simply jaascript deobfuscation

deobfuscate the `login.js` file in js folder and look for the res variable at the bottom.

Don't be fooled by the fake flag in dashboard page...the author himself said it was a flag for test

just decode the `ascii` code from the deobfuscated `res` variable to get the flag
