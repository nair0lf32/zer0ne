Welcome friend, I am nairolf32, A cyberecurity enthusiast slowly getting stronger. I Play CTFs and challenges on various websites and decided to keep a track of what I already know/did/learnt by writing it down. Here is a good place for that. This repository used to simply host my CTF writeups but I turnt it into a blog.

Here I share the best things I learnt throughout my learning journey

Feel free to check the [Blog]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "CTFs") to read my shitty articles

If you are interrested in my CTF writeups a good place to start is [Here]({{< ref "/posts/CTFs" >}} "CTFs")
