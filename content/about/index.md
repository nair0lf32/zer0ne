## Hello friend,

{{< image src="/pictures/dark_logo.png" alt="nairolf32" position="center" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 50%" >}}

Welcome friend, I am nairolf32, A cyberecurity enthusiast slowly getting stronger. I Play CTFs and challenges on various websites and decided to keep a track of what I already know/did/learnt by writing it down. Here is a good place for that. This repository used to simply host my ctf writeups but I turnt it into a blog.

Here I share the best things I learnt throughout my learning journey

The writeups are from many platforms. My favorites ones are Tryhackme and Hackthebox and the writeups are mostly for those.

Also, [wherever I feel like getting the fun and knoweledge](https://ctfsites.github.io/)

I removed some of the old writeups and guided challenges to keep the repo light and clean. The platforms/websites are already there to teach/guide so no need to keep that here.
If I judge a challenge/ctf too basic or easy (solution easily available) it may not appear here.
I might keep those that quickly wrap important concepts or specific vulnerabilities

- [infosecwriteups](https://infosecwriteups.com/): many people post writeups there, but remember it is part of medium (not free)
- [awesomectf](https://c4pr1c3.github.io/awesome-ctf/) they have writeups too. That and...well, everything about ctfs

Good luck and Have fun!
