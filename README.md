Hello friend ðŸ¤–, welcome to my simple writeups repo. I am nairolf32.  
I am learning a bit of cyberecurity and slowly getting stronger,  
I Played some ctfs on various websites ( I am no expert yet, merely a beginner  
but I am getting there someday )

I decided to keep a track of what I already know/did/learnt by writing it down  
Here is a good place for that. In this repository you can find all my ctf stuff.  
The writeups are from many platforms. My favorites ones are:

- ### Hackthebox:

[ ![nairolf32](https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/607474)](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/607474)  
 well I am just beginning there and still learning in the academy

- ### Tryhackme:

- ### Cyberseclabs:
  [cyberseclabs profile ](https://www.cyberseclabs.co.uk/profile)

There is a folder for each platform/website, and subfolders for every machine/box/ctf  
the writeups are named after every ctf machine/room in markdown format.

Most are walktrough with detailled steps of how I did them...some are "inspired" from
others (I got stuck sometimes...)

I also provide in the writeup subfolder files needed and used for the ctfs.

But for the sake of effort I won't show flags. I give everything needed...credentials, exploits, keys...But No flags. with what is given you can get the flag anyway if you ever decide to use my writeups.

looking forward bigger CTF's and maybe a carreer in cyber? 

Hackerlab.bj, Oscp, Hackerone bounty hunts, Google ctf...

Potential objectives I am working toward :)
