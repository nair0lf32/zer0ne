Hello friend ðŸ¤–, welcome to my simple writeups repo. I am nairolf32.  
I am learning a bit of cyberecurity and slowly getting stronger,  
I Played some ctfs on various websites ( I am no expert yet, merely a beginner  
but I am getting there someday )

I decided to keep a track of what I already know/did/learnt by writing it down  
Here is a good place for that. In this repository you can find all my ctf stuff.  
The writeups are from many platforms. My favorites ones are:

- ### Hackthebox

[![nairolf32](https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/607474)](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/607474)  
 well I am just beginning there and still learning in the academy

- ### Tryhackme

- ### Cyberseclabs

[My cyberseclabs profile](https://www.cyberseclabs.co.uk/profile)

There is a folder for each platform/website, and subfolders for every machine/box/ctf  
the writeups are named after every ctf machine/room in markdown format.

Most are walktrough with detailled steps of how I did them...some are "inspired" from
others (I get stuck sometimes)

For the sake of effort I won't share flags. I give everything needed...credentials, exploits, keys...smetimes, But No flags.

with what is given you can get the flag anyway if you ever decide to use my writeups.

Looking forward bigger CTF's and maybe a carreer in cyber?

Hackerlab.bj, Oscp, Hackerone bounty hunts, and more.

Other places I fool around (not writing writeups yet but playing challenges):

- [Cybertalents](https://cybertalents.com/members/nairolf32/profile)
- [hacker101](https://ctf.hacker101.com/) ([hackerone](https://hackerone.com/nairolf?type=user) prep)
- [Overthewire wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
- [googleCTF](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/beginners-quest)
- [hellbound hackers](https://hbh.sh/user/nairolf32)
- [pentesterlab](https://pentesterlab.com)
- [hackthisite?](https://www.hackthissite.org/user/view/nairolf32/)
- [vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)

Also I am planning to remove the old writeups and guided challenges to keep the repo light and clean

The platforms/websites are already there to teach/guide so no need to keep them here.

So If I judge a challenge/ctf too basic or easy (I mean the solution is easily available) it may not appear here.

I might keep some for the moment (Mostly those that quickly wrap important concepts)

Good luck and Have fun!
