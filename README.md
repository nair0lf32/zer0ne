Hello friend ðŸ¤–,

I am nairolf32, A cyberecurity enthusiast slowly getting stronger. I Play CTFs and challenges on various websites and decided to keep a track of what I already know/did/learnt by writing it down. Here is a good place for that. This repository used to simply host my ctf writeups but I turnt it into a blog.

Here I share the best things I learnt throughout my learning journey

The writeups are from many platforms. My favorites ones are Tryhackme and Hackthebox and the writeups are mostly for those.

You can click [here](https://nair0lf32.github.io/zer0ne/about/) to learn more about it!

## Usage:

This repository is not really open for external contributions but feel free to open an issue for anything you want to share

simply clone the repo with `git clone` and run `hugo` (it manages everything for you)

Most importantly, as I use a submodule theme you need to get it locally too using

`git submodule init`then `git submodule update`

This is deployed with `github pages + actions`

To test it run below commands:

`hugo server` for local development then `hugo -D` for building

Check [hugo website](https://gohugo.io/) for more informations
