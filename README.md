Hello friend ðŸ¤–, welcome to my simple writeups repo. I am nairolf32. 

I am learning a bit of cyberecurity and slowly getting stronger 

I Played some ctfs on various websites ( I am no expert yet, merely a beginner  
but I am getting there someday )

I decided to keep a track of what I already know/did/learnt by writing it down 

Here is a good place for that. In this repository you can find all my ctf stuff. 

The writeups are from many platforms. My favorites ones are:

- ### Hackthebox

[![nairolf32](https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/607474)](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/607474)

 well I am just beginning there and still learning in the academy

- ### Tryhackme

- ### Cyberseclabs

[My cyberseclabs profile](https://www.cyberseclabs.co.uk/profile)

## Usage:

There is a folder for each platform/website, and subfolders for every machine/box/ctf 

the writeups are named after every ctf machine/room in markdown format.

Most are walktrough with detailled steps of how I did them...some are "inspired" from
others (I get stuck sometimes)

For the sake of effort I won't share flags. I give everything needed...credentials, exploits, keys...sometimes, But No flags.

with what is given you can get the flag anyway if you ever decide to use my writeups.

## Miscellaneous

Looking forward bigger CTF's (and maybe a carreer in cyber?)

(Hackerlab.bj, Oscp, Hackerone bounty hunts...)

Other places I fool around (not writing writeups yet but playing challenges):

- [portswigger](https://portswigger.net/) (they made burp)
- [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/users/nairolf32) (great one)
- [Cybertalents](https://cybertalents.com/members/nairolf32/profile)
- [hacker101](https://ctf.hacker101.com/) ( [hackerone](https://hackerone.com/nairolf?type=user) prep )
- [Overthewire wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
- [googleCTF](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/beginners-quest)
- [hellbound hackers](https://hbh.sh/user/nairolf32)
- [pentesterlab](https://pentesterlab.com)
- [hackthisite?](https://www.hackthissite.org/user/view/nairolf32/)
- [vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
- [root-me](https://www.root-me.org/nairolf32) (french platform)


Also I am planning to remove the old writeups and guided challenges to keep the repo light and clean

The platforms/websites are already there to teach/guide so no need to keep them here.

So If I judge a challenge/ctf too basic or easy (I mean the solution is easily available) it may not appear here.

I might keep some for the moment (Mostly those that quickly wrap important concepts)

## Similar projects

And as I like linking and sharing stuff (curation is my passion lol) here is similar projects (other people making great writeups)

Note that I won't include those who give flags away (this is a fine selection sir)

- [0xdf hack stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/): mostly htb machines but this guy is still active (searching a box is not available though)
- [infosecwriteups](https://infosecwriteups.com/): many people post writeups there, but remember it is part of medium (not free)
- [awesomectf](https://c4pr1c3.github.io/awesome-ctf/) they have writeups too. That and...well, everything about ctfs

Good luck and Have fun!
