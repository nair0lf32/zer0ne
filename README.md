# CTF's Writeups

Hello friend ðŸ¤–, welcome to my simple writeups repo. I am nairolf32.  
I recently became a big fan of cyberecurity and currently getting stronger  
playing ctfs on various websites. I am no expert yet, merely a beginner  
but I am getting there someday.  


I decided to keep a track of what i already know/did/learnt by writing it down
Here is a good place for that. In this repository you can find all my ctf stuff.
The writeups are from many platforms. My favorites ones are:

- ### Hackthebox: 
[ ![nairolf32](https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/607474)](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/607474)  
 well I am just beginning there and still learning in the academy   
 
- ### Tryhackme: 
[ ![nairolf](https://tryhackme-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/nairolf.png)](https://tryhackme.com/p/nairolf)    

- ### Cyberseclabs:  
[ ![Nairolf32](https://www.cyberseclabs.co.uk/profile)](https://www.cyberseclabs.co.uk/profile)
( I barely tested this one)  
 

There is a folder for each platform/website, and subfolders for every machine/box/ctf  
the writeups are named after every ctf machine/room in markdown format.  


Most are walktrough with detailled steps of how I did them...some are "inspired" from
others (I got stuck sometimes...)  

looking forward bigger CTF's and maybe a carreer in cyber? Hackerlab.bj, Oscp, Hackerone bounty hunts  
Google ctf...

those are some of my potential objectives
