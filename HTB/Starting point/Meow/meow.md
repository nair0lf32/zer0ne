## Enumeration

### nmap

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION
23/tcp open  telnet  syn-ack Linux telnetd
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

that's a lot of open ports

confusion is not even allowed

just telnet as root bro (`-l root`)

```
telnet [-468ELadr] [-S tos] [-b address] [-e escapechar] [-l user]
       [-n tracefile] [host [port]]
```

then go get that well deserved root flag!
